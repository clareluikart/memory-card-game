# Clare Rickard Memory Game Project
This is a simple memory card game with 16 cards, made with starter code from Udacity.
To play the game, click any of the 16 cards to see the other side. Click another card to see if they match. They will both flip back over to if they do not match. Repeat until you have matched all the cards!
To open the game, open index.html with Google Chrome or your preferred browser.
This game is dependent on font-awesome, javascript, bootstrap, and the font "Coda" from Google fonts.
